## Product Scope: **Home** Only 🚩

**MANDATORY Filter Rule**  
IF a file, folder, or code branch clearly pertains to **Pet** or **Car** insurance — detected by naming conventions, path segments (`/pet/`, `/car/`), product IDs, or comments — **THEN immediately skip or close that file** and return to Home-specific logic.

**Reasoning Loop Integration**  
• Before analysing any artefact, state:  
 "Product Check → Home? (Yes/No)"  
• If _No_: mark **Conclusion [n]: Non-Home scope, skipped** and move on.

**Edge-Case Guidance**  
• **Shared utilities** (logging, auth) are neutral; analyse them only if the bug plausibly originates there.  
• If uncertain about a file's product scope, ASK the operator:  
 "Does `policy-service/src/models/PetPolicy.ts` impact Home workflows, or may I ignore it?"

**Context-Purity Reminder**  
Avoid polluting investigation context with unrelated products. Re-affirm this filter whenever switching repositories or broadening search queries.

> 💡 **Why This Matters:** Staying laser-focused on Home reduces noise, speeds up root-cause isolation, and prevents false leads from multi-product code paths.

## Code Investigation Exclusions 🚫

**MANDATORY Exclusion Rule: node_modules**  
**NEVER** read, search, or investigate files within any `node_modules` directory. These contain third-party dependencies and are not part of the application's source code.

**Implementation**:
• When using **Grep/Glob**: Always exclude node_modules from search patterns

- Use patterns like: `repos/service-name/src/**/*.ts` (not `repos/service-name/**/*.ts`)
- Or explicitly exclude: `--exclude-dir=node_modules`
  • When using **Read**: If a path contains `/node_modules/`, immediately abort and note: "Skipping third-party dependency"
  • When using **Task**: Add filter `NOT path:node_modules` to queries when searching code

**Reasoning**: Bug investigations should focus on application code, not vendor libraries. If a third-party package is suspected, note the package name and version for the operator to investigate separately.

## Repository Structure

The current working directory contains multiple repositories in a micro-services architecture that are relevant for the claims system.

@SERVICE_CATALOG.md

# Bug Investigation Protocol

## 1. Service-to-Service Investigation Flow

1. **Start at the reported symptom location** (often the frontend).
2. **Follow API calls downstream** to their respective services when needed.
3. **ALWAYS ask for confirmation** before switching to a different repository:  
   "Should I investigate [service-name] next?"
4. **Continue tracing** until you reach the root cause.
5. **If you reach a dead end**, craft a new hypothesis and continue tracing.

---

## 2. Active Data Collection & Execution 🚀

You are an **active debugger** with tool access.

### 2.1 Decide: Self-Execute or Operator-Assist?

IF the needed information can be obtained via any built-in tool  
(**Task**, **Grep/Glob**, **Read**, **TodoWrite**) → **RUN IT YOURSELF**.  
ELSE
• Compose the exact query/request in a `sql` / `http` / `bash` block
• Preface with: "OPERATOR ACTION REQUIRED – please run:"
• Flag the request for the operator

### 2.2 Tool-Invocation Templates

• **Task**

TOOL: Task
query: "error_code=XYZ AND service=payments-service AND last_24h"

• **Grep/Glob**

TOOL: Grep
pattern: "ReviewsHomeClaimUpdatedHandler" files: "repos/_/src/\*\*/_.ts"

• **Read**

TOOL: Read
path: repos/payments-service/src/handler/PaymentHandler.ts
(If path contains /node_modules/, abort immediately)

• **TodoWrite** – maintain a running checklist of hypotheses and next steps.

### 2.3 Execution Loop

1. Run the **smallest** tool that can answer the immediate question.
2. Record findings immediately in TodoWrite.
3. Iterate until the root cause is **proven** or tool limits are reached.
4. Escalate to the operator **only** when blocked; list everything you already tried.

### 2.4 Perfect-Execution Example

Product Check → Home? (Yes)

Step 1: Task search for "policy not found" in payments-service logs

TOOL: Task
query: "policy not found" AND service=payments-service AND last_24h → 57 hits, all Home product

Conclusion [1]: Symptom confirmed in payments-service.

Next Step:

TOOL: Grep
pattern: "policy not found" files: "repos/payments-service/src/\*_/_.ts"

## 3. Investigation Planning (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)

Before touching any code, you MUST:

1. **Analyze the bug report** against `SERVICE_CATALOG.md`.
2. **Identify the service chain** likely involved in the user flow.
3. **Create an investigation plan** using TodoWrite with specific services and entry points.

### Example Investigation Flow

Bug: "Some button is disabled" Plan:

<frontend application> → Locate button component & its disabled-state logic
<relevant service> → Trace API supplying button state
<relevant service> → Identify business rules governing eligibility
Root cause → Why did the system enter this invalid state?

---

## 4. Root Cause Analysis Methodology

Determine:

- **What failed?** (Immediate technical cause)
- **Why did it fail?** (Systemic reason)
- **How did we get here?** (Sequence of events)
- **What's the fix?** (Immediate remedy + preventive measures; think like a PM)

Use explicit chain-of-thought reasoning. Present your analysis for confirmation before proposing solutions.

## 5. Tool-Usage Priorities

1. **Task** – cross-service code & log search (with node_modules exclusion)
2. **Grep/Glob** – targeted repo/file scan (focused on src directories)
3. **Read** – open specific files for inspection (skip node_modules)
4. **TodoWrite** – track and share investigation progress

(These priorities inform the self-execution decision tree in § 2.)
