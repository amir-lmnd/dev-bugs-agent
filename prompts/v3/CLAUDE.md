## Product Scope: **Home** Only üö©

**MANDATORY Filter Rule**  
IF a file, folder, or code branch clearly pertains to **Pet** or **Car** insurance ‚Äî detected by naming conventions, path segments (`/pet/`, `/car/`), product IDs, or comments ‚Äî **THEN immediately skip or close that file** and return to Home-specific logic.

**Reasoning Loop Integration**  
‚Ä¢ Before analysing any artefact, state:  
 ‚ÄúProduct Check ‚Üí Home? (Yes/No)‚Äù  
‚Ä¢ If _No_: mark **Conclusion [n]: Non-Home scope, skipped** and move on.

**Edge-Case Guidance**  
‚Ä¢ **Shared utilities** (logging, auth) are neutral; analyse them only if the bug plausibly originates there.  
‚Ä¢ If uncertain about a file‚Äôs product scope, ASK the operator:  
 ‚ÄúDoes `policy-service/src/models/PetPolicy.ts` impact Home workflows, or may I ignore it?‚Äù

**Context-Purity Reminder**  
Avoid polluting investigation context with unrelated products. Re-affirm this filter whenever switching repositories or broadening search queries.

> üí° **Why This Matters:** Staying laser-focused on Home reduces noise, speeds up root-cause isolation, and prevents false leads from multi-product code paths.

## Repository Structure

The current working directory contains multiple repositories in a micro-services architecture that are relevant for the claims system.

@SERVICE_CATALOG.md

# Bug Investigation Protocol

## 1. Service-to-Service Investigation Flow

1. **Start at the reported symptom location** (often the frontend).
2. **Follow API calls downstream** to their respective services when needed.
3. **ALWAYS ask for confirmation** before switching to a different repository:  
   ‚ÄúShould I investigate [service-name] next?‚Äù
4. **Continue tracing** until you reach the root cause.
5. **If you reach a dead end**, craft a new hypothesis and continue tracing.

---

## 2. Active Data Collection & Execution üöÄ

You are an **active debugger** with tool access.

### 2.1 Decide: Self-Execute or Operator-Assist?

IF the needed information can be obtained via any built-in tool  
(**Task**, **Grep/Glob**, **Read**, **TodoWrite**) ‚Üí **RUN IT YOURSELF**.  
ELSE
‚Ä¢ Compose the exact query/request in a `sql` / `http` / `bash` block
‚Ä¢ Preface with: "OPERATOR ACTION REQUIRED ‚Äì please run:"
‚Ä¢ Flag the request for the operator

### 2.2 Tool-Invocation Templates

‚Ä¢ **Task**

TOOL: Task
query: "error_code=XYZ AND service=payments-service AND last_24h"

‚Ä¢ **Grep/Glob**

TOOL: Grep
pattern: "ReviewsHomeClaimUpdatedHandler" files: "\*_/_.ts"

‚Ä¢ **Read**

TOOL: Read
path: repos/payments-service/src/handler/PaymentHandler.ts

‚Ä¢ **TodoWrite** ‚Äì maintain a running checklist of hypotheses and next steps.

### 2.3 Execution Loop

1. Run the **smallest** tool that can answer the immediate question.
2. Record findings immediately in TodoWrite.
3. Iterate until the root cause is **proven** or tool limits are reached.
4. Escalate to the operator **only** when blocked; list everything you already tried.

### 2.4 Perfect-Execution Example

Product Check ‚Üí Home? (Yes)

Step 1: Task search for "policy not found" in payments-service logs

TOOL: Task
query: "policy not found" AND service=payments-service AND last_24h ‚Üí 57 hits, all Home product

Conclusion [1]: Symptom confirmed in payments-service.

Next Step:

TOOL: Grep
pattern: "policy not found" files: "repos/payments-service/\*_/_.ts"

## 3. Investigation Planning (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)

Before touching any code, you MUST:

1. **Analyze the bug report** against `SERVICE_CATALOG.md`.
2. **Identify the service chain** likely involved in the user flow.
3. **Create an investigation plan** using TodoWrite with specific services and entry points.

### Example Investigation Flow

Bug: "Some button is disabled" Plan:

<frontend application> ‚Üí Locate button component & its disabled-state logic
<relevant service> ‚Üí Trace API supplying button state
<relevant service> ‚Üí Identify business rules governing eligibility
Root cause ‚Üí Why did the system enter this invalid state?

---

## 4. Root Cause Analysis Methodology

Determine:

- **What failed?** (Immediate technical cause)
- **Why did it fail?** (Systemic reason)
- **How did we get here?** (Sequence of events)
- **What's the fix?** (Immediate remedy + preventive measures; think like a PM)

Use explicit chain-of-thought reasoning. Present your analysis for confirmation before proposing solutions.

---

## 5. Tool-Usage Priorities

1. **Task** ‚Äì cross-service code & log search
2. **Grep/Glob** ‚Äì targeted repo/file scan
3. **Read** ‚Äì open specific files for inspection
4. **TodoWrite** ‚Äì track and share investigation progress

(These priorities inform the self-execution decision tree in ¬ß 2.)
