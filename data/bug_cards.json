How the flow should work is that we list all items in VC, then Blender takes the amounts, calculates if needs to pay ACV or RCV and let to issue the payment. Numbers are not suppose to be edited inside Blender, so when we try to issue a payment as one line item, same will happen. The question is - what does it mean that the match was not matching up? this is the issue to be solved here. do you have a cart where all items should be listed?",

Second, the claim is indeed out of the policy range, that is visible in Blender (see screenshot), so this is not a technical bug, I'd say it's more a question to CLX why this claim was paid, but since its from 5 years ago it sounds like its to late for that.\nIf you have more recent claims do let us know we'll take a look to make sure there are no tech issues.

While the policy is `Active`, both the policy and claim show the relevant exclusion alert/tag (3rd/4th screenshots). I then canceled the policy, and observed that the policy/claim no longer have the relevant exclusion alert/tag (5th/6th screenshots). @oshik.zigler @shai.gon.paz I'm not sure if this falls under Renters Growth or Bionics Product squad.
