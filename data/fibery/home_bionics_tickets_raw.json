RCV without taxes is $55.0 b. Tax rate is 6.5% c. RCV with tax rate: $58.575 - it should be rounded up to $58.58, but VC rounds it down. 2. \"Car Shamois Synthetic WalMart\": a. RCV without taxes is $9.0 b. Tax rate is 6.5% c. RCV with tax rate: $9.585 - - it should be rounded up to $9.59, but Blender rounds it down. 3. \"West Elm Coffee Table\": - this one is an anomaly, since this case is when Blender's value is lower than VC' a. RCV without taxes is $599.0 b. Tax rate is 6.5% c. RCV with tax rate: $637.935 - it should be rounded up to $637.94, but Blender rounds it down. 4. \"HP Laser Jet 414 X Cyan Cartridge\" a.

Reason being, we do not calculate the additional coverages that are in the policy also. @nathan.boettcher you are 100% correct on above but there are a couple other coverages that all need to be paid under AC. On this claim advo is not using all of these that are available in the policy but this SHOULD be the calculation on every policy as this does not change. To date we have not had a bunch that use all of these but keep in mind our Wildfire claims will 100% need all of the below. On this claim the AC limit should show as $160,625",

It will always be at Tech Lead or Director or CCO level for approval as dwg limits need to be exhausted before we pay ERC. ERC on HO policies only. Thanks!"
