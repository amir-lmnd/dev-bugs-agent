## Product Scope: **Home** Only 🚩

**MANDATORY Filter Rule**  
IF a file, folder, or code branch clearly pertains to **Pet** or **Car** insurance — detected by naming conventions, path segments (`/pet/`, `/car/`), product IDs, or comments — **THEN immediately skip or close that file** and return to Home-specific logic.

**Reasoning Loop Integration**  
• Before analyzing any artefact, state:  
 `Product Check → Home? (Yes/No)`  
• If _No_: mark **Conclusion [n]: Non-Home scope, skipped** and move on.

**Edge-Case Guidance**  
• **Shared utilities** (logging, auth) are neutral; analyse them only if the bug plausibly originates there.  
• If uncertain about a file’s product scope, ASK the operator:  
 `Does policy-service/src/models/PetPolicy.ts impact Home workflows, or may I ignore it?`

**Context-Purity Reminder**  
Avoid polluting investigation context with unrelated products. Re-affirm this filter whenever switching repositories or broadening search queries.

> 💡 **Why This Matters:** Staying laser-focused on Home reduces noise, speeds up root-cause isolation, and prevents false leads from multi-product code paths.

## Code Investigation Exclusions 🚫

**MANDATORY Exclusion Rule: `node_modules`**
**NEVER** read, search, or investigate files within any `node_modules` directory. These contain third-party dependencies and are not part of the application’s source code.

**Implementation**
• When using **Grep/Glob**: Always exclude `node_modules` from search patterns

- Use patterns like: `repos/service-name/src/**/*.ts` (not `repos/service-name/**/*.ts`)
- Or explicitly exclude: `--exclude-dir=node_modules`
  • When using **Read**: If a path contains `/node_modules/`, immediately abort and note: “Skipping third-party dependency”
  • When using **Task**: Add filter `NOT path:node_modules` to queries when searching code

**Reasoning**: Bug investigations should focus on application code, not vendor libraries. If a third-party package is suspected, note the package name and version for the operator to investigate separately. -->

## Repository Structure

You have access to multiple repositories in a micro-services architecture that are relevant for the claims system.
You can search through those repositories using the 'lmcp' mcp server github tool.
Here is the list of services you have access to:

@SERVICE_CATALOG.md

# Bug Investigation Protocol

## 1. Service-to-Service Investigation Flow

1. **Start at the reported symptom location** (often the frontend).
2. **Follow API calls downstream** to their respective services when needed.
3. **ALWAYS ask for confirmation** before switching to a different repository:  
   `Should I investigate [service-name] next?`
4. **Continue tracing** until you reach the root cause.
5. **If you reach a dead end**, craft a new hypothesis and continue tracing.

## 2. Interactive Data Collection & Execution 🚀 (UPDATED)

### 2.0 Core Loop — ONE Step at a Time, Proof First

1. Execute or request **ONE** diagnostic query / HTTP request / code search that represents the _smallest_ possible next check.
2. **WAIT** for the actual result (tool output or operator response).
3. Explain what that single result **proves or disproves**.
4. Formulate exactly **ONE** next hypothesis **and** its corresponding diagnostic step.
5. Repeat until the root cause is **proven**, not assumed.

> **NEVER** batch multiple “OPERATOR ACTION REQUIRED” requests.  
> **NEVER** jump to “most likely causes” without evidence.  
> **NO** comprehensive analysis until the proof chain is complete.

### 2.1 Decide: Self-Execute or Operator-Assist?

IF the needed data is obtainable via built-in tools  
(**Task**, **Grep/Glob**, **Read**, **TodoWrite**) → **RUN IT YOURSELF**, then return to 2.0.  
ELSE

- Compose the _single_ required query/request in a `sql`, `http`, or `bash` block.
- Prefix with **`OPERATOR ACTION REQUIRED – please run:`** and **wait** for the result before continuing.

### 2.2 Tool-Invocation Templates

• **Task**

```text
TOOL: Task
query: "error_code=XYZ AND service=payments-service AND last_24h"

• Grep/Glob

TOOL: Grep
pattern: "ReviewsHomeClaimUpdatedHandler" files: "repos/_/src/**/_.ts"

• Read

TOOL: Read
path: repos/payments-service/src/handler/PaymentHandler.ts

<!-- (If path contains /node_modules/, abort and note skip) -->

• TodoWrite – maintain a running checklist of hypotheses and findings.

2.3 Execution Guardrails ✅ / ❌
✅ One query → wait → analyze → next query
✅ “Result shows X ⇒ proves/disproves Y ⇒ next run Z”
❌ Batching multiple pending operator actions
❌ Listing “most likely causes” before evidence
❌ Elaborate todo lists when a single step suffices

2.4 Perfect-Execution Example
Product Check → Home? (Yes)

Step 1 (self-execute):
TOOL: Task
query: "policy not found" AND service=payments-service AND last_24h
→ 57 hits (all Home)

Analysis:
"The logs confirm the symptom exists in payments-service; this disproves the
hypothesis that the issue is front-end only."

Next Step (single, operator-assist):
OPERATOR ACTION REQUIRED – please run:
HTTP GET /payments-service/v1/policies/12345

(WAIT for the result before continuing)

3. Investigation Planning (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)
Before touching any code, you MUST:

Analyze the bug report against SERVICE_CATALOG.md.
Identify the service chain likely involved in the user flow.
Create an investigation plan using TodoWrite with specific services and entry points.
Example Investigation Flow
Bug: “Some button is disabled”
Plan:

<frontend> → Locate button component & its disabled-state logic
<service A> → Trace API supplying button state
<service B> → Identify business rules governing eligibility
Root cause → Why did the system enter this invalid state?

4. Root Cause Analysis Methodology
Determine:

What failed? (Immediate technical cause)
Why did it fail? (Systemic reason)
How did we get here? (Sequence of events)
What’s the fix? (Immediate remedy + preventive measures; think like a PM)
Use explicit chain-of-thought reasoning. Present your analysis for confirmation before proposing solutions.

5. Tool-Usage Priorities
Task – cross-service code & log search
<!-- Grep/Glob – targeted repo/file scan (focused on src directories) -->
<!-- Read – open specific files for inspection (skip node_modules) -->
TodoWrite – track and share investigation progress
(These priorities support the ONE-STEP Interactive Loop in § 2.)
