##### Tasks #####


##### Pre agent steps #####
  1. bug card generation

##### Agent Steps #####
  1. Identify relevant repos, expect output: list of repos
    why extra step? it will allow us to use a detailed service catalog

  2. Investigate
    ...
  3. Export results


##### Tools needed #####

- SQL generation
  input: name of a model, repo, fields wanted
  output: SQL query runnable on Snowflake
  why: - it constantly doesn't recognize that claims table have encryptedId fields instead of publicId - in case of snowflake, we need to prefix the table name with the schema name, dont want to have this instruction in the general system prompt



- Session Memory Bank
  Why: during a long investigation it repeatedly asked for the same data

- Define Available Tools Clearly
  Why: I has a session where it tried to figure out how we are logging:
    ⏺ Task(Find logging configuration and search patterns)
    ⎿ Search(pattern: "(logger\.info|logger\.error|logger\.warn|logger\.debug)._claim", include: "_.{js,ts}")
    Found 226 files (ctrl+r to expand)
    +13 more tool uses
    ⎿ No (tell Claude what to do differently)

- Logs tool

- MCP for the domain

- Human in the loop feedback

- Rerun with human inputs





GTM 
  - home bionics
  - pet bionics

  start using cli tool locally in  interactive mode
  learn
    iterate over prompt
    build tools (mainly mcp)

  deploy as a service
  run agent on every incoming bug report
    have investigation quality rating collection method

  ....
