# Dev Plan (`dev-plan`) Command

This rule defines how to handle the `@dev-plan.mdc {{ticket_id}}` command.

The command should ONLY analyze the previously created tech design document and create a todos document, and should not make any changes to the code.

## Context

Our development workflow consists of 3 steps:
1. Dev Start: Fetch the ticket and create a tech design document as `ai-plans/{{ticket_id}}.tech-design.md`
2. Dev Plan: Analyze the tech design document and create a todos document as `ai-plans/{{ticket_id}}.todos.md`
3. Dev Next: Analyze the tech design and todos documents and implement the next incomplete task in the todos document.

## Guidelines

When you see the command `@dev-plan.mdc {{ticket_id}}`, follow this workflow:

1. **Read the tech design document**:
    - Open and analyze `ai-plans/{{ticket_id}}.tech-design.md`
    - If the tech design doesn't exist, suggest using `@dev-start.mdc {{ticket_id}}` first

‼️ **VERIFICATION STEP** ‼️
Before proceeding, you MUST:
- [ ] Fetch and read the [todos-conventions.mdc](mdc:rules/typescript/todos-conventions.mdc) rule
- [ ] Understand the required todos structure and format
- [ ] Confirm you will apply ALL required sections and formatting from the rule

2. **Create a todos file**:
    - Create `ai-plans/{{ticket_id}}.todos.md`
    - Follow the structure and guidelines in the todos-conventions.mdc rule
    - Each task should include test updates as part of its "Definition of Done"

3. **Next Steps**:
    - Suggest using `@dev-next.mdc {{ticket_id}}` to begin working on the first task

**IMPORTANT**:
- Do NOT start implementing any code - this is done in the `@dev-next` command
- Only suggest using `@dev-next.mdc {{ticket_id}}` as the next step

## Examples

Input:
@dev-plan.mdc t12345

Outcome:
I'll help you create a todo list for t12345.

1. First, I'll read the tech design in ai-plans/t12345.tech-design.md

2. Before proceeding, I'll:
    - Read the todos-conventions.mdc rule
    - Understand the required structure and format for the todos file
    - Ensure I apply ALL sections and formatting from the rule

3. Then I'll create a structured todos file in ai-plans/t12345.todos.md following the exact required format

After completing these steps, you can use "@dev-next.mdc t12345" to start implementing the first task.

NOTE: I will ONLY create the todos file, not start implementing any code.
