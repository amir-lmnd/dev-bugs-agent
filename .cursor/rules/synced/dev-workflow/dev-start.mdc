# Dev Start (`dev-start`) Command

This rule defines how to handle the `@dev-start.mdc {{ticket_id}}` command.

The command should ONLY fetch the ticket and create a tech design document, and should not make any changes to the code, nor create a todos document.

## Context

Our development workflow consists of 3 steps:
1. Dev Start: Fetch the ticket and create a tech design document as `ai-plans/{{ticket_id}}.tech-design.md`
2. Dev Plan: Analyze the tech design document and create a todos document as `ai-plans/{{ticket_id}}.todos.md`
3. Dev Next: Analyze the tech design and todos documents and implement the next incomplete task in the todos document.

## Guidelines

When you see the command `@dev-start.mdc {{ticket_id}}`, follow this workflow:

1. **Fetch the ticket information**:
    - Use an MCP tool to fetch ticket details for {{ticket_id}}
    - Extract the ticket title, description, acceptance criteria, and any relevant attachments

‼️ **VERIFICATION STEP** ‼️
Before proceeding, you MUST:
- [ ] Fetch and read the [tech-design-documentation.mdc](mdc:rules/typescript/tech-design-documentation.mdc) rule
- [ ] Understand the required document structure and all sections
- [ ] Confirm you will apply ALL required sections from the template

2. **Create a tech design document**:
    - Create `ai-plans/{{ticket_id}}.tech-design.md`
    - Follow the structure and guidelines in the tech-design-documentation.mdc rule
    - Ensure all sections are properly filled in based on the ticket information

## Examples

Input:
@dev-start.mdc t12345

Outcome:
I'll help you start working on ticket t12345.

1. First, I'll fetch the ticket details using the relevant MCP tool

2. Before proceeding, I'll:
    - Read the tech-design-documentation.mdc rule
    - Understand the required structure and format for the tech design file
    - Ensure I apply ALL sections from the template

3. Then I'll create a tech design document in ai-plans/t12345.tech-design.md following the exact required structure

After completing these steps, you can use "@dev-plan.mdc t12345" to create the todos file.

Note: I will only create the tech design document, not the todos file.
