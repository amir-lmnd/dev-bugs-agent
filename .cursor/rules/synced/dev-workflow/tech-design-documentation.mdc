# Technical Design Documentation

This rule defines the process and structure for creating technical design documents.

## Guidelines

After clarifying requirements, create a comprehensive technical design document:

1. Save all technical designs in the `ai-plans/` directory
2. Use the ticket ID as the filename (`{{ticket_id}}.tech-design.md`)
3. Follow the standardized structure outlined below

### Technical Design Document Structure:

```markdown
# Context
Describe the feature, problem, and previous handling.

# Affected Components & Services
- List each bounded-context, service, provider, module, or class to modify, including:
  - Repo/module name
  - Package or namespace
  - Class/file path(s)
  - Method(s) or API surface to update

# Component Flow & Interaction

## Diagram
[Insert Mermaid flowchart illustrating component interactions]

## Interaction Details
For each step in the diagram, specify the involved component/provider and the method signature or HTTP endpoint.

# API Design
Describe enhancements to existing endpoints or new APIs, referencing controller/handler classes and DTOs.

# Special Considerations

## DB / Data Changes
Detail schema, model, and domain object modifications.

## Performance
Assess potential performance impacts and mitigations.

## Security
Call out authentication, authorization, and sensitive data handling.

## Monitoring
Identify metrics, tags, and alerting strategies.

## Documentation
Note required updates to external and internal docs.

## Tech Debt
Highlight any follow-up tasks to reduce future maintenance complexity.

# Implementation Plan
1. Update `SomeService.calculate()` to set explicit reasons.
2. Add `someProperty` field to `SomeModel` domain model.
3. Modify `SomeController` and DTO mapping to include the new field.
5. Write unit tests for service logic and integration tests for the API.
```

Always create this document before starting implementation and share it with the user for approval.

## Examples

Input:
Ticket: t12342
Type: FEATURE
Title: Add VIN validation for vehicle registration

Output (After requirements clarification):
I'll create a technical design document for this feature. You'll find it at `ai-plans/t12342.tech-design.md` once complete.

The document will follow our standardized technical design format covering:
- Context of the VIN validation feature
- Affected components & services
- Component flow & interaction
- API design details
- Special considerations and implementation plan
