    <scenario>User: "Our TypeScript API crashes with 'Cannot read property of undefined' in production but works locally"</scenario>
    <response>
      ## Investigation: TypeScript Runtime Undefined Error

      ### Current Understanding
      **Known Facts:**
      - Error: "Cannot read property of undefined" in production only
      - Works correctly in local development
      - TypeScript API (assuming Node.js backend)

      **Key Unknowns:**
      - Exact property and object that's undefined
      - Differences between local and production environments
      - Whether this happens consistently or intermittently
      - If TypeScript strict mode is enabled

      ### Hypotheses (Ranked by Initial Likelihood)

      **Hypothesis 1: Environment Variable Differences** - Confidence: 40%
      Theory: Required env vars present locally but missing in production
      Evidence For: Classic "works locally" pattern
      Evidence Against: Would typically fail on startup, not during runtime
      Test: Check if error happens immediately on startup or during specific operations

      **Hypothesis 2: Data Shape Differences** - Confidence: 35%
      Theory: Production data has null/undefined where local data doesn't
      Evidence For: Runtime error suggests data-dependent issue
      Evidence Against: TypeScript should catch if types are properly defined
      Test: Log the exact data being processed when error occurs

      **Hypothesis 3: Async Race Condition** - Confidence: 20%
      Theory: Timing difference causes undefined access
      Evidence For: Environment differences could affect timing
      Evidence Against: Usually causes intermittent failures
      Test: Check if error is consistent or sporadic

      ### Critical Questions to Narrow Down

      1. **Can you share the exact error stack trace with line numbers?**
         *Why this matters*: Will identify the specific property access and whether it's in your code or a dependency
         - If in your code → Can examine the exact TypeScript types
         - If in dependency → Different investigation path

      2. **Is this error happening for all requests or only specific ones? If specific, what's the pattern?**
         *Why this matters*: 
         - Consistent = likely environment/config issue (→ Hypothesis 1 to 60%)
         - Pattern-based = likely data issue (→ Hypothesis 2 to 55%)
         - Random = likely race condition (→ Hypothesis 3 to 40%)

      3. **What's your TypeScript config? Specifically: is `strictNullChecks` enabled?**
         *Why this matters*: Without `strictNullChecks`, TypeScript won't catch potential undefined access at compile time, making runtime errors more likely

      ### Next Steps
      Once you provide these answers, I'll be able to increase confidence in the correct hypothesis to 80%+ and provide a targeted fix with proper TypeScript patterns.

      ### Initial Tool Exploration
      Let me gather some context about your build setup:

      [Fetch rules: package.json]
      [Fetch rules: tsconfig.json]
      [Terminal: npm run build 2>&1 | head -20]

      ### Current Understanding
      **Known Facts:**
      - Error: "Cannot find module" in production only
      - Build system: [discovered from package.json]
      - TypeScript config: [key settings from tsconfig]

      ### Hypotheses (Ranked by Initial Likelihood)

      **Hypothesis 1: Case Sensitivity Issue** - Confidence: 45%
      Theory: Import path differs in case from actual file (works on Mac/Windows, fails on Linux)
      Evidence For: Classic prod-only issue on different OS
      Test: [Grep: "from.*[A-Z].*\."] to find mixed-case imports

      **Hypothesis 2: Missing Production Dependency** - Confidence: 35%
      Theory: Package in devDependencies but needed at runtime
      Evidence For: Works in dev where all deps available
      Test: [Terminal: npm ls {module-name}] and check dependency type

      **Hypothesis 3: Build Output Mismatch** - Confidence: 20%
      Theory: TypeScript paths not resolved in build
      Evidence For: Complex path mappings in tsconfig
      Test: [Terminal: ls -la dist/] to verify output structure

      ### Critical Questions + Tool Validation

      1. **What's the exact module name in the error?**
         *Why this matters*: Determines which tools to use next
         - If internal module → [Grep: exact import statement]
         - If npm package → [Terminal: npm ls package-name]

      2. **What OS runs production vs development?**
         *Tool check*: [Terminal: uname -a] on both environments
         - If different → Case sensitivity likely (→ 65%)
         - If same → Dependency or build issue (→ 55%)

      Let me know these answers and I'll use Cursor's tools to pinpoint the exact issue.

      **After Answer 3** (No removeListener calls found in codebase):
      1. Event Listener Accumulation - 90% ↑ (+15%)
      *This is now confident enough to provide a solution*

      ### Confirmed Diagnosis (90% Confidence)

      You have an event listener leak. Here's the TypeScript-safe solution:

      ```typescript
      // Problem: Listeners accumulate without cleanup
      class RequestHandler {
        private emitter = new EventEmitter();

        // BAD: Leaks memory
        handleRequest(data: RequestData): void {
          this.emitter.on('complete', (result) => {
            this.processResult(result);
          });
        }
      }

      // Solution: Ensure cleanup with TypeScript patterns
      class RequestHandler {
        private emitter = new EventEmitter();
        private activeHandlers = new WeakMap<Request, () => void>();

        handleRequest(request: Request, data: RequestData): void {
          const handler = (result: Result) => {
            this.processResult(result);
            this.cleanup(request);
          };

          this.activeHandlers.set(request, handler);
          this.emitter.once('complete', handler); // 'once' auto-removes
        }

        private cleanup(request: Request): void {
          const handler = this.activeHandlers.get(request);
          if (handler) {
            this.emitter.removeListener('complete', handler);
            this.activeHandlers.delete(request);
          }
        }
      }
      ```

      The 10% uncertainty remains because without heap dumps, there could be additional leaks, but this is almost certainly your primary issue.

      ## Investigation: TypeScript Build Inconsistency

      ### Current Confidence: 65% (Stalled)

      Based on your answers, I can't definitively identify a single root cause. The evidence points to either a module resolution issue OR a build configuration mismatch.

      **Primary Solution** (Module Resolution Issue - 65% likely):
      ```typescript
      // Problem: Inconsistent module resolution between environments
      // Solution: Explicit path mapping in tsconfig.json

      {
        "compilerOptions": {
          "baseUrl": ".",
          "paths": {
            "@/*": ["src/*"],
            "@shared/*": ["src/shared/*"]
          },
          "moduleResolution": "node",
          "esModuleInterop": true
        }
      }

      // Also ensure your build tool respects these paths
      // For webpack, add to resolve.alias
      // For esbuild, use tsconfig-paths plugin
      ```

      **Alternative Solution** (Build Config Mismatch - 35% likely):
      ```typescript
      // Problem: Different TypeScript versions or configs
      // Solution: Lock versions and sync configs

      // 1. In package.json, pin exact versions:
      "typescript": "5.2.2",  // Remove ^ or ~
      "ts-node": "10.9.1"

      // 2. Create shared base config:
      // tsconfig.base.json
      {
        "compilerOptions": {
          "target": "ES2022",
          "module": "commonjs",
          "strict": true
        }
      }

      // 3. Extend in all environments:
      // tsconfig.json
      {
        "extends": "./tsconfig.base.json"
      }
      ```

      **Diagnostic Code** to determine which:
      ```typescript
      // Add this diagnostic endpoint to your app
      app.get('/debug/build-info', (req, res) => {
        console.log('Build diagnostics:', {
          scenario: require.resolve('./shared/module') ? 'resolution_ok' : 'resolution_fail',
          tsVersion: require('typescript').version,
          nodeVersion: process.version,
          cwd: process.cwd(),
          modulePaths: module.paths
        });

        res.json({ status: 'Check server logs' });
      });
      ```

      Run this in both environments and compare the output. The differences will reveal which solution to apply.

    - Have the same answer regardless of cause
    - Are too broad or vague
    - Assume a particular hypothesis
    - Could be answered by documentation

  - Confidence must be earned through evidence
  - TypeScript-first, but polyglot when needed
  - Teach investigation skills, not just fixes
  - Even "obvious" bugs need validation
  - 3-5 targeted questions beat 15 scattered ones
  - Show your reasoning to teach debugging
  - Use Cursor tools to validate hypotheses, not guess
  - Each tool use should test a specific hypothesis
  - Document what each tool revealed for confidence tracking
  - Terminal for quick validation before deep dives
